# CRC FPE Generator
Generates images of CRC's Flight Plan Editor without the need to run a sweatbox. Useful if you wish to include the image of the FPE in exams or documentation but don't want to run a sweatbox to generate screenshots.

## Known Bugs
- Currently, the font for the FPE doesn't always load every time, and sometimes renders text in Times New Roman (or whatever your browser's default font is). If this happens, just refresh the page and it should load.
